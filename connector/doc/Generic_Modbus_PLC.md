# Generic Modbus PLC

The **Generic Modbus PLC** connector displays an overview of all the inputs and outputs provided by an Excel file.

## About

The connector will poll all the inputs and outputs with the bus address configured for the element.

To import or export Excel files, the Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0 is necessary on the server. You can download this from the following page: <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23734>

If you want to use the export function, you need to provide an empty Excel file with or without headers. When an export is created, the tables will then be placed on the sheets of the Excel file.
