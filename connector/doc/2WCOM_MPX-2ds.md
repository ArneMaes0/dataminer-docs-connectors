## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *161*).

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to Use

On the **Polling Config** page, you can configure which polling groups should be polled. By default, they are all disabled.

The **Virtual Common Audio Decoder Input Sources Ts Demux** table shows which SAT tuner each service uses by displaying "RF1" or "RF2" in the StrInfo column. This impacts the **RF Level**, **C/N**, and **TS Sync** values of the **Service Info** table.
