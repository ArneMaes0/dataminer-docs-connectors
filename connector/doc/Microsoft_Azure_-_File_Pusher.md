# Microsoft Azure - File Pusher

## About

**Azure File Pusher** is used to enable periodic or manually triggered uploads of local files to Azure Blob Storage, where their content can be used for further analysis or online access. It helps automate file synchronization from local storage to Azure Blob Storage in an easy and intuitive way.
<br>
<br>
Credentials for authentication are securely stored within the collector, and used every time files are uploaded.
<br>
You can configure multiple file path combinations, each with dedicated upload settings, allowing flexible file transfers to the Azure Blob Storage that best fits your use case.
<br>
<br>
